read more about once your off your phone? Keep them in the cloud with
Skratchpad! Backbone was at the core of Skratchpads user interface,

was used to style it. Express running on node with a mongodb data
store was used to save client data on the backend.

*** app/skratchpad.js
    Client models and collections stored here.

** Server
